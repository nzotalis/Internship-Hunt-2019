Here are some of the projects I have worked on for classes, notably from my Artificial Intelligence class. I included these because
they are easy to share and demonstrate my coding ability. I may be uploading some more class projects in the future.

Calculator - Parses input string and returns result, supports many functions such as sqrt, exp, etc.
Contains a self-implemented Stack data structure
Any expression not containing parentheses will be evaluated in linear time
Supports variables, multi-line calculation as well as asterisk omission (2x works as well as 2*x)

Sudoku - Reads a Sudoku board in from a notepad where * represent empty squares
Can find solution to most puzzles almost instantly, can solve world's hardest puzzle in 16 seconds or less!

Spam Filter - Self explanatory
I could upload the training data I used to achieve a 96% hit rate upon request.

Markov Model - Generates text resembling a source document
Included frankenstein.txt for illustration purposes
